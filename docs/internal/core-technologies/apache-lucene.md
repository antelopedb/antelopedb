# Apache Lucene

The idea is to use Apache Lucene for:

* AntelopeDB backend model \(application state\).
* To use lucene as centralized log store at the same time.
* To take advance of lucene as distributed backend, just in case of AntelopeDB Manager HA deployments.

The Spikes are tested here:  [https://github.com/javiroman/programming/tree/master/Java/Lucene](https://github.com/javiroman/programming/tree/master/Java/Lucene)
